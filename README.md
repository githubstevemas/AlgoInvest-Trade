# AlgoInvest Trade

This project alow you to find best actions to buy with two versions of code: a brute force version and an optimized version using dynamic programming. 
The program allows users to choose datasets for actions datas, performs RAM and time profiling, and exports profiling graphs. 
The project utilizes libraries such as `psutil`, `itertools`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## Features

- **Two Versions**: 
  - Brute Force: Exhaustively tests all combinations to find the optimal solution.
  - Optimized: Uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the optimal solution.
- **Dataset Selection**: Users can choose different datasets for testing.
- **Profiling**: 
  - RAM usage and execution time profiling.
  - Exports graphs of the profiling results.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `psutil`: For process and system utilization monitoring.
  - `itertools`: For efficient looping and combination generation.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `matplotlib.pyplot`: For plotting and visualizing profiling data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
